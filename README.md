Lander
===

[Latest build here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lander-april/files/latest/download?source=files)

[@sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lander-april/files/builds/)

Summary
===
The player takes control of a vehicle and transports stuff from one place to another. Main level design features will be centered around mofications around the vehicle control physics (waves of force/air/gravity, etc). Finishing missions unlocks upgrades to the vessel that are needed for later missions (space travel, etc). The goal of the game is to complete all levels (at least for now).

Arcade game motivited by [onegameamonth.com](onegameamonth.com). Similar gameplay mechanics to [ugh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugh!) from the early 90s.
